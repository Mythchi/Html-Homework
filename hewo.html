                <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>Hewo! My name is Monica, although i do go by the name Mythchi as an alias. If it's not clear, i am a female. As of right now, i am student of Universitas Sanata Dharma. 
            I am 19 years old, will turn 20 this year. My hobbies includes playing games, singing, reading some webnovels, manga, manhua, comics ,and so on.
            My 2 most attached games right now are Dota 2 and Genshin Impact. I do play other game casually thou. 
            I am the eldest child of my family and also the eldest grandchild from both my dad's and mom's side of the family.
          </p>

          <p>As of right now, i am still in the progress of finishing my IT degree and in that process i have stumbled upon html text, git and github, css, etc.
            This is my smol or mayhaps my big journey of struggles to become a capable programmer. I have some laziness in me and trust me, it's bad. Like, real bad.
            I am taught to be a polite person and i am trying really hard to fufill it. My parents are loving but also strict, ofc i love em so. I am trying hard to fix my past mistakes caused by my own stupidity and ignorance.
            May this year is shall repent upon my mistakes. Hewo again and thankies for taking ur time to read this.
